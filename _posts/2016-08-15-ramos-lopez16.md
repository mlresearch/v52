title: Scalable MAP inference in {B}ayesian networks based on a Map-Reduce approach
abstract: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is a particularly complex type of probabilistic
  inference in Bayesian networks. It consists of finding the most probable configuration
  of a set of variables of interest given observations on a collection of other variables.
  In this paper we study scalable solutions to the MAP problem in hybrid Bayesian
  networks parameterized using conditional linear Gaussian distributions. We propose
  scalable solutions based on hill climbing and simulated annealing, built on the
  Apache Flink framework for big data processing. We analyze the scalability of the
  solution through a series of experiments on large synthetic networks.
