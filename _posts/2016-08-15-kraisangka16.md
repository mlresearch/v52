title: Making Large Cox's Proportional Hazard Models Tractable in {B}ayesian Networks
abstract: 'Cox’s proportional hazard (CPH) model is a statistical technique that captures
  the interaction between a set of risk factors and an effect variable. While the
  CPH model is popular in survival analysis, Bayesian networks offer an attractive
  alternative that is intuitive, general, theoretically sound, and avoids CPH model’s
  restrictive assumptions. Existing CPH models are a great source of existing knowledge
  that can be reused in Bayesian networks. The main problem with applying Bayesian
  networks to survival analysis is their exponential growth in complexity as the number
  of risk factors increases. It is not uncommon to see complex CPH models with as
  many as 20 risk factors. Our paper focuses on making large survival analysis models
  derived from the CPH model tractable in Bayesian networks. We evaluate the effect
  of two complexity reduction techniques: (1) parent divorcing, and (2) removing less
  important risk factors based on the accuracy of the resulting models.'
