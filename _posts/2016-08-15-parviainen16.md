title: Bayesian Networks for Variable Groups
abstract: Bayesian networks, and especially their structures, are powerful tools for
  representing conditional independencies and dependencies between random variables.
  In applications where related variables form \empha priori known groups, chosen
  to represent different “views” to or aspects of the same entities, one may be more
  interested in modeling dependencies between groups of variables rather than between
  individual variables. Motivated by this, we study prospects of representing relationships
  between variable groups using Bayesian network structures. We show that for dependency
  structures between groups to be expressible exactly, the data have to satisfy the
  so-called groupwise faithfulness assumption. We also show that one cannot learn
  causal relations between groups using only groupwise conditional independencies,
  but also variable-wise relations are needed. Additionally, we present algorithms
  for finding the groupwise dependency structures.
