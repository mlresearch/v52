title: 'Relevant Path Separation: A Faster Method for Testing Independencies in Bayesian
  Networks'
abstract: "\\emphDirected separation (d-separation) played a fundamental role in the
  founding of \\emphBayesian networks (BNs) and continues to be useful today in a
  wide range of applications. Given an independence to be tested, current implementations
  of d-separation explore the \\emphactive part of a BN. On the other hand, an overlooked
  property of d-separation implies that d-separation need only consider the \\emphrelevant
  part of a BN. We propose a new method for testing independencies in BNs, called
  \\emphrelevant path separation (rp-separation), which explores the intersection
  between the active and relevant parts of a BN. Favourable experimental results are
  reported."
