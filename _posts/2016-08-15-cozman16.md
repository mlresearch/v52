title: 'Probabilistic Graphical Models Specified by Probabilistic Logic Programs:
  Semantics and Complexity'
abstract: 'We look at probabilistic logic programs as a specification language for
  probabilistic models, and study their interpretation and complexity. Acyclic programs
  specify Bayesian networks, and, depending on constraints on logical atoms, their
  inferential complexity reaches complexity classes #\mathsfP, #\mathsfNP, and even
  #\mathsfEXP. We also investigate (cyclic) stratified probabilistic logic programs,
  showing that they have the same complexity as acyclic probabilistic logic programs,
  and that they can be depicted using chain graphs.'
