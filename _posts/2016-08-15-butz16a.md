title: On Bayesian Network Inference with Simple Propagation
abstract: "\\emphSimple Propagation (SP) was recently proposed as a new join tree
  propagation algorithm for exact inference in discrete Bayesian networks and empirically
  shown to be faster than \\emphLazy Propagation (LP) when applied on optimal (or
  close to) join trees built from real-world and benchmark Bayesian networks. This
  paper extends SP in two directions. First, we propose and empirically evaluate eight
  heuristics for determining elimination orderings in SP. Second, we show that the
  relevant potentials in SP are precisely those in LP."
