title: A Hybrid Causal Search Algorithm for Latent Variable Models
abstract: Existing score-based causal model search algorithms such as \textitGES (and
  a speeded up version, \textitFGS) are asymptotically correct, fast, and reliable,
  but make the unrealistic assumption that the true causal graph does not contain
  any unmeasured confounders. There are several constraint-based causal search algorithms
  (e.g \textitRFCI, \emphFCI, or \emphFCI+) that are asymptotically correct without
  assuming that there are no unmeasured confounders, but often perform poorly on small
  samples. We describe a combined score and constraint-based algorithm, \emphGFCI,
  that we prove is asymptotically correct. On synthetic data, \textitGFCI is only
  slightly slower than \emphRFCI but more accurate than \textitFCI, \textitRFCI and
  \textitFCI+.
