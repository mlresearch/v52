title: An Exact Approach to Learning Probabilistic Relational Model
abstract: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) offer a popular framework including
  a variety of statistical formalisms, such as Bayesian networks (BNs). These latter
  are able to depict real-world situations with high degree of uncertainty. Due to
  their power and flexibility, several extensions were proposed, ensuring thereby
  the suitability of their use. Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) extend BNs
  to work with relational databases rather than propositional data. Their construction
  represents an active area since it remains the most complicated issue. Only few
  works have been proposed in this direction, and most of them don’t guarantee an
  optimal identification of their dependency structure. In this paper we intend to
  propose an approach that ensures returning an optimal PRM structure. It is inspired
  from a BN method whose performance was already proven.
