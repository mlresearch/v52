title: Bayesian Torrent Classification by File Name and Size Only
abstract: Torrent traffic, much of which is assumed to be illegal downloads of copyrighted
  content, accounts for up to 35% of internet downloads. Yet, the process of classification
  and identification of these downloads is unclear, and original data for such studies
  is often unavailable. Many torrent items lack supporting description or meta-data,
  in which case only file name and size are available. We describe a novel Bayesian
  network based classifier system that predicts medium category, pornographic content
  and risk of fakes and malware based on torrent name and size, optionally supplemented
  with external databases of titles and actors. We show that our method outperforms
  a commercial benchmark system and has the potential to rival human classifiers.
