title: On Construction of Hybrid Logistic Regression-Na\"ive {B}ayes Model for Classification
abstract: In recent years, several authors have described a hybrid discriminative-generative
  model for classification. In this paper we examine construction of such hybrid models
  from data where we use logistic regression (LR) as a discriminative component, and
  na√Øve Bayes (NB) as a generative component. First, we estimate a Markov blanket
  of the class variable to reduce the set of features. Next, we use a heuristic to
  partition the set of features in the Markov blanket into those that are assigned
  to the LR part, and those that are assigned to the NB part of the hybrid model.
  The heuristic is based on reducing the conditional dependence of the features in
  NB part of the hybrid model given the class variable. We implement our method on
  21 different classification datasets, and we compare the prediction accuracy of
  hybrid models with those of pure LR and pure NB models.
