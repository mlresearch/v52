title: Compressing Bayes Net CPTs with Persistent Leaky Causes
abstract: Non-Impeding Noisy-AND (NIN-AND) Trees (NATs) offer a highly expressive
  compressed casual model for significantly reducing space and inference time of Bayesian
  Nets (BNs). A causal model often includes a leaky cause for all causes not explicitly
  named. A leaky cause may be persistent or not. A conditional probability table (CPT)
  in a BN often behaves as if there is a persistent leaky cause (PLC). We discuss
  limitations for not modeling PLC explicitly during compression. We also reveal challenges
  if PLC is explicitly modeled. We extend an earlier solution that is limited to binary
  NAT models and is incomplete, to a solution that is applicable to multi-valued NAT
  models and is complete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution experimentally
  for compressing general BN CPTs with PLCs.
