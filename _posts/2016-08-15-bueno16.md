title: 'Learning Complex Uncertain States Changes via Asymmetric Hidden Markov Models:
  an Industrial Case'
abstract: In many problems involving multivariate time series, Hidden Markov Models
  (HMMs) are often employed to model complex behavior over time. HMMs can, however,
  require large number of states, that can lead to overfitting issues especially when
  limited data is available. In this work, we propose a family of models called Asymmetric
  Hidden Markov Models (HMM-As), that generalize the emission distributions to arbitrary
  Bayesian-network distributions. The new model allows for state-specific graphical
  structures defined over the space of observable features, what renders more compact
  state spaces and hence a better handling of the complexity-overfitting trade-off.
  We first define asymmetric HMMs, followed by the definition of a learning procedure
  inspired on the structural expectation-maximization framework allowing for decomposing
  learning per state. Then, we relate representation aspects of HMM-As to standard
  and independent HMMs. The last contribution of the paper is a set of experiments
  that elucidate the behavior of asymmetric HMMs on practical scenarios, including
  simulations and industry-based scenarios. The empirical results indicate that HMMs
  are limited when learning structured distributions, what is prevented by the more
  parsimonious representation of HMM-As. Furthermore, HMM-As showed to be promising
  in uncovering multiple graphical structures and providing better model fit in a
  case study from the domain of large-scale printers, thus providing additional problem
  insight.
