title: Statistical Matching of Discrete Data by Bayesian Networks
abstract: Statistical matching (also known as data fusion, data merging, or data integration)
  is the umbrella term for a collection of methods which serve to combine different
  data sources. The objective is to obtain joint information about variables which
  have not jointly been collected in one survey, but on two (or more) surveys with
  disjoint sets of observation units. Besides specific variables for the different
  data files, it is indispensable to have common variables which are observed in both
  data sets and on basis of which the matching can be performed. Several existing
  statistical matching approaches are based on the assumption of conditional independence
  of the specific variables given the common variables. Relying on the well-known
  fact that d-separation is related to conditional independence for a probability
  distribution which factorizes along a directed acyclic graph, we suggest to use
  probabilistic graphical models as a powerful tool for statistical matching. In this
  paper, we describe and discuss first attempts for statistical matching of discrete
  data by Bayesian networks. The approach is exemplarily applied to data collected
  within the scope of the German General Social Survey.
