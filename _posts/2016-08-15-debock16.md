title: Reintroducing Credal Networks under Epistemic Irrelevance
abstract: A credal network under epistemic irrelevance is a generalised version of
  a Bayesian network that loosens its two main building blocks. On the one hand, the
  local probabilities do not have to be specified exactly. On the other hand, the
  assumptions of independence do not have to hold exactly. Conceptually, these credal
  networks are elegant and useful. However, in practice, they have long remained very
  hard to work with, both theoretically and computationally. This paper provides a
  general introduction to this type of credal networks and presents some promising
  new theoretical developments that were recently proved using sets of desirable gambles
  and lower previsions. We explain these developments in terms of probabilities and
  expectations, thereby making them more easily accessible to the Bayesian network
  community.
