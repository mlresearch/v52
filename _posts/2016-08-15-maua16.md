title: The Effect of Combination Functions on the Complexity of Relational Bayesian
  Networks
abstract: 'We study the complexity of marginal inference with Relational Bayesian
  Networks as parameterized by their probability formulas. We show that without combination
  functions, inference is #\sc\MakeLowercaseP-equivalent, displaying the same complexity
  as standard Bayesian networks (this is so even when relations have unbounded arity
  and when the domain is succinctly specified in binary notation). By allowing increasingly
  more expressive probability formulas using only maximization as combination, we
  obtain inferential complexity that ranges from #\sc\MakeLowercasep-equivalent to
  \sc\MakeLowercasefpspace-complete to \sc\MakeLowercaseexp-hard. In fact, by suitable
  restrictions to the number of nestings of combination functions, we obtain complexity
  classes in all levels of the counting hierarchy. Finally, we investigate the use
  of arbitrary combination functions and obtain that inference is \sc\MakeLowercasefexp-complete
  even under a seemingly strong restriction.'
