title: Dynamic Sum Product Networks for Tractable Inference on Sequence Data
abstract: Sum-Product Networks (SPN) have recently emerged as a new class of tractable
  probabilistic models. Unlike Bayesian networks and Markov networks where inference
  may be exponential in the size of the network, inference in SPNs is in time linear
  in the size of the network. Since SPNs represent distributions over a fixed set
  of variables only, we propose dynamic sum product networks (DSPNs) as a generalization
  of SPNs for sequence data of varying length. A DSPN consists of a template network
  that is repeated as many times as needed to model data sequences of any length.
  We present a local search technique to learn the structure of the template network.
  In contrast to dynamic Bayesian networks for which inference is generally exponential
  in the number of variables per time slice, DSPNs inherit the linear inference complexity
  of SPNs. We demonstrate the advantages of DSPNs over DBNs and other models on several
  datasets of sequence data.
