title: Joint {B}ayesian Modelling of Internal Dependencies and Relevant Multimorbidities
  of a Heterogeneous Disease
abstract: A heterogeneous target disease represented by multiple descriptors and disease
  subtypes frequently has a rich internal dependency structure. The identification
  of comorbidities and particularly the multimorbidities of such diseases requires
  very large sample size as relevant comorbidities may form complex interactions.
  We demonstrate this phenomena by applying a Bayesian probabilistic graphical model
  on a large-scale medical datasets UK Biobank (117,392 samples), specifically by
  showing that in this case the posterior landscape of multimorbidities is still flat.
  As a potential solution, we evaluate a Bayesian method, which provides a hierarchic,
  multivariate characterization of strongly relevant morbidities and a Bayesian, systems-based
  score for exploring interactions for a heterogeneous disease. It explores complete
  sets of strongly relevant comorbidities using full multivariate representation for
  the internal dependencies within the target disease. We used depression as target,
  a heterogeneous disease in the UK Biobank dataset. Results are compared against
  scenarios using a univariate and an independent, multivariate representation of
  the target medical condition, specifically investigating multitarget interaction
  posteriors and its approximations.
