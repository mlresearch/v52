title: Hybrid Copula {B}ayesian Networks
abstract: This paper introduces the hybrid copula Bayesian network (HCBN) model, a
  generalization of the copula Bayesian network (CBN) model developed by Elidan (2010)
  for continuous random variables to multivariate mixed probability distributions
  of discrete and continuous random variables. To this end, we extend the theorems
  proved by Nešlehovà (2007) from bivariate to multivariate copulas with discrete
  and continuous marginal distributions. Using the multivariate copula with discrete
  and continuous marginal distributions as a theoretical basis, we construct an HCBN
  that can model all possible permutations of discrete and continuous random variables
  for parent and child nodes, unlike the popular conditional linear Gaussian network
  model. Finally, we demonstrate on a numerous synthetic datasets and a real life
  dataset that our HCBN compares favorably, from a modeling and flexibility viewpoint,
  to other hybrid models including the conditional linear Gaussian and the mixture
  of truncated exponentials models.
