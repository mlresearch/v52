title: Learning Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs from Observations and Interventions
abstract: We introduce a new family of mixed graphical models that consists of graphs
  with possibly directed, undirected and bidirected edges but without directed cycles.
  Moreover, there can be up to three edges between any pair of nodes. The new family
  includes Richardson’s acyclic directed mixed graphs, as well as Andersson-Madigan-Perlman
  chain graphs. These features imply that no family of mixed graphical models that
  we know of subsumes the new models. We also provide a causal interpretation of the
  new models as systems of structural equations with correlated errors. Finally, we
  describe an exact algorithm for learning the new models from observational and interventional
  data via answer set programming.
