title: 'Evidence Evaluation: a Study of Likelihoods and Independence'
abstract: In the context of evidence evaluation, where the probability of evidence
  given a certain hypothesis is considered, different pieces of evidence are often
  combined in a naive way by assuming conditional independence. In this paper we present
  a number of results that can be used to assess both the importance of a reliable
  likelihood-ratio estimate and the impact of neglecting dependencies among pieces
  of evidence for the purpose of evidence evaluation. We analytically study the effect
  of changes in dependencies between pieces of evidence on the likelihood ratio, and
  provide both theoretical and empirical bounds on the error in likelihood occasioned
  by assuming independences that do not hold in practice. In addition, a simple measure
  of influence strength between pieces of evidence is proposed.
