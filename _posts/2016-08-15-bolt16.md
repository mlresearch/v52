title: 'Bayesian Networks: a Combined Tuning Heuristic'
abstract: One of the issues in tuning an output probability of a Bayesian network
  by changing multiple parameters is the relative amount of the individual parameter
  changes. In an existing heuristic parameters are tied such that their changes induce
  locally a maximal change of the tuned probability. This heuristic, however, may
  reduce the attainable values of the tuned probability considerably. In another existing
  heuristic parameters are tied such that they simultaneously change in the entire
  interval ⟨0,1⟩. The tuning range of this heuristic will in general be larger then
  the tuning range of the locally optimal heuristic. Disadvantage, however, is that
  knowledge of the local optimal change is not exploited. In this paper a heuristic
  is proposed that is locally optimal, yet covers the larger tuning range of the second
  heuristic. Preliminary experiments show that this heuristic is a promising alternative.
