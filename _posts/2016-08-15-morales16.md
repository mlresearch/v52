title: Regression Methods Applied to Flight Variables for Situational Awareness Estimation
  Using Dynamic Bayesian Networks
abstract: Situational awareness can be a valuable indicator of the performance of
  flight crews and the way pilots manage navigation information can be relevant to
  its estimation. In this research, dynamic Bayesian networks are applied to a dataset
  of variables both collected in real time during simulated flights and added with
  expert knowledge. This paper compares different approaches to the discretization
  of continuous variables and to the estimation of pilot actions based on variable
  regression, in order to optimize the model performance.
