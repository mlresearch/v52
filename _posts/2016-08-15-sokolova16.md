title: Computing Lower and Upper Bounds on the Probability of Causal Statements
abstract: 'Causal discovery provides an opportunity to infer causal relationships
  from purely observational data and to predict the effect of interventions. Constraint-based
  methods for causal discovery exploit conditional (in)dependencies to infer the direction
  of causal relationships. They typically work through forward chaining: given some
  causal statements, others can be inferred by applying relatively straightforward
  causal logic such as transitivity and acyclicity. Starting from the premise that
  we can estimate reliabilities for base causal statements, we propose a novel approach
  to estimate the reliability of novel statements inferred by forward chaining. Since
  reliabilities for base statements are clearly dependent, if only because inferred
  from the same data, exact computation is infeasible. However, lending ideas from
  the area of imprecise probability theory, we can compute bounds on the reliabilities
  on inferred statements. Specifically, we make use of the good old Fr√©chet inequalities
  and discuss two different variants: greedy and delayed. In simulation experiments,
  we show that the delayed variant, at the expense of more bookkeeping and computation
  time, does provide slightly tighter intervals. We illustrate our method on a real-world
  data set about attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.'
