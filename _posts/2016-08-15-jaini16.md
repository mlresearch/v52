title: Online Algorithms for Sum-Product Networks with Continuous Variables
abstract: Sum-product networks (SPNs) have recently emerged as an attractive representation
  due to their dual interpretation as a special type of deep neural network with clear
  semantics and a tractable probabilistic graphical model. We explore online algorithms
  for parameter learning in SPNs with continuous variables. More specifically, we
  consider SPNs with Gaussian leaf distributions and show how to derive an online
  Bayesian moment matching algorithm to learn from streaming data. We compare the
  resulting generative models to stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and generative
  moment matching networks on real-world datasets.
