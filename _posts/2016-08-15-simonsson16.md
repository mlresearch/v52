title: Exact Inference on Conditional Linear Î“-Gaussian Bayesian Networks
abstract: Exact inference for Bayesian Networks is only possible for quite limited
  classes of networks. Examples of such classes are discrete networks, conditional
  linear Gaussian networks, networks using mixtures of truncated exponentials, and
  networks with densities expressed as truncated polynomials. This paper defines another
  class with exact inference, based on the normal inverse gamma conjugacy. We describe
  the theory of this class as well as exemplify our implemented inference algorithm
  in a practical example. Although generally small and simple, we believe these kinds
  of networks are potentially quite useful, on their own or in combination with other
  algorithms and methods for Bayesian Network inference.
