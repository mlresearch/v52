title: Learning Tractable Multidimensional {B}ayesian Network Classifiers
abstract: Multidimensional classification has become one of the most relevant topics
  in view of the many domains that require a vector of class values to be assigned
  to a vector of given features. The popularity of multidimensional Bayesian network
  classifiers has increased in the last few years due to their expressive power and
  the existence of methods for learning different families of these models. The problem
  with this approach is that the computational cost of using the learned models is
  usually high, especially if there are a lot of class variables. Class-bridge decomposability
  means that the multidimensional classification problem can be divided into multiple
  subproblems for these models. In this paper, we prove that class-bridge decomposability
  can also be used to guarantee the tractability of the models. We also propose a
  strategy for efficiently bounding their inference complexity, providing a simple
  learning method with an order-based search that obtains tractable multidimensional
  Bayesian network classifiers. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive
  with other methods in the state of the art and ensures the tractability of the learned
  models.
