title: Decisions and Dependence in Influence Diagrams
abstract: "The concept of dependence among variables in a Bayesian belief network
  is well understood, but what does it mean in an influence diagram where some of
  those variables are decisions? \t\tThere are three quite different answers to this
  question that take the familiar concepts for uncertain variables and extend them
  to decisions. \t\tFirst is responsiveness, whether the choice for a decision affects
  another variable. \t\tSecond is materiality, whether observing other variables before
  making a decision affects the choice for the decision and thus improves its quality.
  \t\tThird is the usual notion of dependence, assuming that all of the decisions
  are made optimally given the information available at the time of the decisions.
  \t\tThere are some subtleties involved, but all three types of decision dependence
  can be quite useful for understanding a decision model."
