title: On Pruning with the MDL Score
abstract: The space of Bayesian network structures is forbiddingly large and hence
  numerous techniques have been developed to prune this search space, but without
  eliminating the optimal structure. Such techniques are critical for structure learning
  to scale to larger datasets with more variables. Prior works exploited properties
  of the MDL score to prune away large regions of the search space that can be safely
  ignored by optimal structure learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose new
  techniques for pruning regions of the search space that can be safely ignored by
  algorithms that enumerate the k-best Bayesian network structures. Empirically, we
  show that these techniques allow a state-of-the-art structure enumeration algorithm
  to scale to datasets with significantly more variables.
