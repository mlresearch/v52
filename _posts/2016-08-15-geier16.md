title: On Stacking Probabilistic Temporal Models with Bidirectional Information Flow
abstract: We discuss hierarchical combinations of probabilistic models where the upper
  layer is crafted for predicting time-series data. The combination of models makes
  the naïve Bayes assumption, stating that the latent variables of the models are
  independent given the time-indexed label variables. In this setting an additional
  independence assumption between time steps and mildly inconsistent results are often
  accepted to make inference computationally feasible. We discuss how the application
  of approximate inference to the practically intractable joint model instead, shifts
  the need for these simplifications from model design time to inference time, and
  the application of loopy belief propagation to the joint model realizes bidirectional
  communication between models during inference. A first empirical evaluation of the
  proposed architecture on an activity recognition task demonstrates the benefits
  of the layered architecture and examines the effects of bidirectional information
  flow.
