title: The Parameterized Complexity of Approximate Inference in {B}ayesian Networks
abstract: Computing posterior and marginal probabilities constitutes the backbone
  of almost all inferences in Bayesian networks. These computations are known to be
  intractable in general, both to compute exactly and to approximate by sampling algorithms.
  While it is well known under what constraints \em exact computation can be rendered
  tractable (viz., bounding tree-width of the moralized network and bounding the cardinality
  of the variables) it is less known under what constraints \em approximate Bayesian
  inference can be tractable. Here, we use the formal framework of \em fixed-error
  randomized tractability (a randomized analogue of fixed-parameter tractability)
  to address this problem, both by re-interpreting known results from the literature
  and providing some additional new results, including results on fixed parameter
  tractable de-randomization of approximate inference.
