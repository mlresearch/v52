title: Causal Discovery from Subsampled Time Series Data by Constraint Optimization
abstract: This paper focuses on causal structure estimation from time series data
  in which measurements are obtained at a coarser timescale than the causal timescale
  of the underlying system. Previous work has shown that such subsampling can lead
  to significant errors about the system’s causal structure if not properly taken
  into account. In this paper, we first consider the search for the system timescale
  causal structures that correspond to a given measurement timescale structure. We
  provide a constraint satisfaction procedure whose computational performance is several
  orders of magnitude better than previous approaches. We then consider finite-sample
  data as input, and propose the first constraint optimization approach for recovering
  the system timescale causal structure. This algorithm optimally recovers from possible
  conflicts due to statistical errors. More generally, these advances allow for a
  robust and non-parametric estimation of system timescale causal structures from
  subsampled time series data.
