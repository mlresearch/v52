title: Estimating Causal Effects with Ancestral Graph Markov Models
abstract: We present an algorithm for estimating bounds on causal effects from observational
  data which combines graphical model search with simple linear regression. We assume
  that the underlying system can be represented by a linear structural equation model
  with no feedback, and we allow for the possibility of latent variables. Under assumptions
  standard in the causal search literature, we use conditional independence constraints
  to search for an equivalence class of ancestral graphs. Then, for each model in
  the equivalence class, we perform the appropriate regression (using causal structure
  information to determine which covariates to include in the regression) to estimate
  a set of possible causal effects. Our approach is based on the “IDA” procedure of
  Maathuis et al. (2009), which assumes that all relevant variables have been measured
  (i.e., no unmeasured confounders). We generalize their work by relaxing this assumption,
  which is often violated in applied contexts. We validate the performance of our
  algorithm on simulated data and demonstrate improved precision over IDA when latent
  variables are present.
