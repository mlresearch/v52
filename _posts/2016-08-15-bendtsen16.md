title: Regime Aware Learning
abstract: We propose a regime aware learning algorithm to learn a sequence of Bayesian
  networks (BNs) that model a system that undergoes \it regime changes. The last BN
  in the sequence represents the systemâ€™s current regime, and should be used for BN
  inference. To explore the feasibility of the algorithm, we create baseline tests
  against learning a singe BN, and show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the
  single BN approach. We also apply the learning algorithm on real world data from
  the financial domain, where it is evident that the algorithm is able to produce
  BNs that have adapted to the regime changes during the most recent global financial
  crisis of 2007-08.
