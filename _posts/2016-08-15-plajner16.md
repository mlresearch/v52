title: Student Skill Models in Adaptive Testing
abstract: This paper provides a common framework, a generic model, for Computerized
  Adaptive Testing (CAT) for different model types. We present question selection
  methods for CAT for this generic model. We use three different types of models,
  Item Response Theory, Bayesian Networks, and Neural Networks, that instantiate the
  generic model. We illustrate the usefulness of a special model condition – the monotonicity
  – and discuss its inclusion in these model types. With Bayesian networks we use
  specific type of learning using generalized linear models to ensure the monotonicity.
  We conducted simulated CAT tests on empirical data. Behavior of individual models
  was assessed based on these tests. The best performing model was the BN model constructed
  by a domain expert its parameters were learned from data under the monotonicity
  condition.
