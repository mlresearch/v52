title: The Chordal Graph Polytope for Learning Decomposable Models
abstract: This theoretical paper is inspired by an \em integer linear programming
  (ILP) approach to learning the structure of \em decomposable models. We intend to
  represent decomposable models by special zero-one vectors, named \em characteristic
  imsets. Our approach leads to the study of a special polytope, defined as the convex
  hull of all characteristic imsets for chordal graphs, named the \em chordal graph
  polytope. We introduce a class of \em clutter inequalities and show that all of
  them are valid for (the vectors in) the polytope. In fact, these inequalities are
  even facet-defining for the polytope and we dare to conjecture that they lead to
  a complete polyhedral description of the polytope. Finally, we propose an LP method
  to solve the \em separation problem with these inequalities for use in a cutting
  plane approach.
