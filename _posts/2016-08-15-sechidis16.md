title: Estimating Mutual Information in Under-Reported Variables
abstract: Under-reporting occurs in survey data when there is a reason to systematically
  misreport the response to a question. For example, in studies dealing with low birth
  weight infants, the smoking habits of the mother are very likely to be misreported.
  This creates problems for calculating effect sizes, such as bias, but these problems
  are commonly ignored due to lack of generally accepted solutions. We reinterpret
  this as a problem of learning from missing data, and particularly learning from
  positive and unlabelled data. By this formalisation we provide a simple method to
  incorporate prior knowledge of the misreporting and we present how we can use this
  knowledge to derive corrected point and interval estimates of the mutual information.
  Then we show how our corrected estimators outperform more complex approaches and
  we present applications of our theoretical results in real world problems and machine
  learning tasks.
