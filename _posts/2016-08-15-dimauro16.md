title: Multi-Label Classification with Cutset Networks
abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of Multi-Label Classification (MLC)
  by using Cutset Networks (CNets), weighted probabilistic model trees, recently proposed
  as \emphtractable probabilistic models for discrete distributions. We employ CNets
  to perform Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference exactly and efficiently and
  we improve a state-of-the-art structure learning algorithm for CNets by explicitly
  taking advantage of label dependencies. We achieve this by forcing the tree inner
  nodes to represent only feature variables and by exploiting structural heuristics
  while learning the leaf models. A thorough experimental evaluation on ten real-world
  datasets shows how the proposed approach improves several metrics for MLC, proving
  it to be competitive with problem transformation methods like classifier chains.
