title: Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Non-Random Missing Data using Informative
  Gaussian Process Priors and Soft Evidences
abstract: We propose an extended Bayesian matrix factorization method, which can incorporate
  multiple sources of side information, combine multiple \empha priori estimates for
  the missing data and integrates a flexible missing not at random submodel. The model
  is formalized as probabilistic graphical model and a corresponding Gibbs sampling
  scheme is derived to perform unrestricted inference. We discuss the application
  of the method for completing drug–target interaction matrices, also discussing specialties
  in this domain. Using real-world drug–target interaction data, the performance of
  the method is compared against both a general Bayesian matrix factorization method
  and a specific one developed for drug–target interaction prediction. Results demonstrate
  the advantages of the extended model.
