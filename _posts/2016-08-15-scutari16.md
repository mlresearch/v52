title: An Empirical-Bayes Score for Discrete Bayesian Networks
abstract: 'Bayesian network structure learning is often performed in a Bayesian setting,
  by evaluating candidate structures using their posterior probabilities for a given
  data set. Score-based algorithms then use those posterior probabilities as an objective
  function and return the \emphmaximum a posteriori network as the learned model.
  For discrete Bayesian networks, the canonical choice for a posterior score is the
  Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) marginal likelihood with a uniform
  (U) graph prior (Heckerman et al., 1995). Its favourable theoretical properties
  descend from assuming a uniform prior both on the space of the network structures
  and on the space of the parameters of the network. In this paper, we revisit the
  limitations of these assumptions and we introduce an alternative set of assumptions
  and the resulting score: the Bayesian Dirichlet sparse (BDs) empirical Bayes marginal
  likelihood with a marginal uniform (MU) graph prior. We evaluate its performance
  in an extensive simulation study, showing that MU+BDs is more accurate than U+BDeu
  both in learning the structure of the network and in predicting new observations,
  while not being computationally more complex to estimate.'
