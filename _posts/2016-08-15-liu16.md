title: Learning Parameters of Hybrid Time Bayesian Networks
abstract: Time granularity is an important factor in characterizing dynamical systems.
  Hybrid time Bayesian networks model the dynamics of systems that contain both irregularly-timed
  variables and variables whose evolution is naturally described by discrete time.
  The former observations are modeled as variables in continuous-time manner and the
  latter are modeled by discrete-time random variables. We address the problem of
  learning parameters of hybrid time models from complete data where all the states
  are known at any time point, and from incomplete trajectories, where continuous-time
  variables are observed only at some time points. We show that for the complete case,
  the parameters can be estimated straightforwardly. When some continuous-time variables
  are (partially) unobserved, it becomes infeasible to learn the parameters in closed
  form. In that case, we propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate
  the posterior distribution over the parameters. We tested the approach on a number
  of hybrid time models where continuous-time variables are completely or partially
  observed, showing that close estimation of the original parameters can be recovered.
  A medical example is used to illustrate the learning parameters of hybrid time Bayesian
  networks.
