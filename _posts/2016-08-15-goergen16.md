title: A Differential Approach to Causality in Staged Trees
abstract: In this paper, we apply a recently developed differential approach to inference
  in staged tree models to causal inference. Staged trees generalise modelling techniques
  established for Bayesian networks (BN). They have the advantage that they can depict
  highly nuanced structure impossible to express in a BN and also enable us to perform
  causal manipulations associated with very general types of interventions on the
  system. Conveniently, what we call the interpolating polynomial of a staged tree
  has been found to be an analogue to the essential graph of a BN. By analysing this
  polynomial in a differential framework, we find that interventions on the model
  can be expressed as a very simple operation. We can therefore clearly state causal
  hypotheses which are invariant for all staged trees representing the same causal
  model. The technology we develop here, illustrated through a simple example, enables
  us to search for a variety of complex manipulations in large systems accurately
  and efficiently.
