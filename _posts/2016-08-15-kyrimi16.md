title: A Progressive Explanation of Inference in `Hybrid' {B}ayesian Networks for
  Supporting Clinical Decision Making
abstract: 'Many Bayesian networks (BNs) have been developed as decision support tools.
  However, far fewer have been used in practice. Sometimes it is assumed that an accurate
  prediction is enough for useful decision support but this neglects the importance
  of trust: a user who does not trust a tool will not accept its advice. Giving users
  an explanation of the way a BN reasons may make its predictions easier to trust.
  In this study, we propose a progressive explanation of inference that can be applied
  to any hybrid BN. The key questions that we answer are: which important evidence
  supports or contradicts the prediction and through which intermediate variables
  does the evidence flow. The explanation is illustrated using different scenarios
  in a BN designed for medical decision support.'
