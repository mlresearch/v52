title: Identifying the irreducible disjoint factors of a multivariate probability
  distribution
abstract: 'We study the problem of decomposing a multivariate probability distribution
  p(\mathbfv) defined over a set of random variables \mathbfV={V_1,…,V_n} into a product
  of factors defined over disjoint subsets {\mathbfV_F_1,…,\mathbfV_F_m}. We show
  that the decomposition of \mathbfV into irreducible disjoint factors forms a unique
  partition, which corresponds to the connected components of a Bayesian or Markov
  network, given that it is faithful to p. Finally, we provide three generic procedures
  to identify these factors with O(n^2) pairwise conditional independence tests (V_i\perp
  V_j \mathbin∣\mathbfZ) under much less restrictive assumptions: 1) p supports the
  Intersection property ii) p supports the Composition property iii) no assumption
  at all.'
